This is my personal website. It includes a portfolio as the home page, and
multiple other pages about my interests. This website is used to practice and
showcase my skills in web development, including:

* Animations
* Responsiveness
* UI/UX
* Interactivity
* Mapping
* and more to come...

The live website is available at https://nikostragkas.eu!
