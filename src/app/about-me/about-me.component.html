    <div>
      <p>
        I am a software engineer, with a passion for web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I studied Computer Science at the Aristotle
        University of Thessaloniki, specializing in the field of Artificial Intelligence. During my studies, I also worked as an intern web developer
        at the university's IT center, working on an updated open-source student information system, which would go on to be used by many universities across Greece.
      </p>
      <p>
        After I got my Bachelor's degree, I continued in the same university, studying Artificial Intelligence.
        During my Master's cycle, I also spent a semester in Madrid, doing an Erasmus+ exchange at the <span lang="es">Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        After finishing my studies, I spent one year in the army, as is required in Greece, and started working full-time at INCA Hellas, where I worked on large
        projects...
