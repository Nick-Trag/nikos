        I am a software engineer, with a passion for web development. I studied Computer Science at the Aristotle
        University of Thessaloniki, specializing in the field of
        Artificial Intelligence. After I got my Bachelor's degree, I continued in the same university, studying
        Artificial Intelligence. During my Master's cycle, I also
        spent a semester in Madrid, doing an Erasmus+ exchange at the <span lang="es">Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid</span>.
        After finishing my studies, I spent one year in the army, as is required in Greece, and am now ready to tackle the next challenge in my life!
